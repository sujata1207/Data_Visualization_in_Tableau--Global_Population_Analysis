# Data_Visualization_in_Tableau--Global_Population_Analysis

<h2>Overview:</h2>
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my data analysis and visualization project centered around Global Population Analysis. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and visually intuitive understanding of the Global population data of 234 countries world wide starting from the year 1980 till 2023 and forecasting it till 2050.

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
The primary objective was to shed light on the growth and spread of the global population by building interactive and visually appealing visualizations using Tableau. Population growth plays a critical role in urban planning, policymaking, resource allocation, and more. Over the course of history, there has been a significant increase in the global population, influenced by various factors such as migration trends, socioeconomic advancements, and mortality and birth rates. Through visualization, I aim to uncover patterns, differences, and trends in population dynamics, enabling a better understanding of the intricate factors driving population development worldwide.

<h2>Tools Used:</h2>
<b>Excel:</b> Utilized for data preprocessing tasks and intermediate analysis.<br>
<b>Tableau:</b> Utilized for creating interactive and insightful visualizations that effectively convey Population trends and growth patterns over the specified period.

<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
<li> The dataset is retrieved from Kaggle and it provides population information for 234 countries across all seven continents. It is divided into four datasets, representing the North, South, East, and West hemispheres. </li>
<li> Prior to analysis, minor transformations were performed on the data set for preparation. </li>
<li>It consists of three dimensions: country, continent, and hemisphere, along with 15 measures. These measures provide various insights into the population dynamics of each country, allowing for analysis and comparisons based on factors such as rank, area, landAreaKm, netChange, growthRate, worldPercentage, density, densityMi, pop1980, 
pop2000, pop2010, pop2022, pop2023, pop2030, pop2050.</li>

<h2>Data Processing</h2> 
The dataset was preprocessed and engineered using Excel to ensure cleanliness and compatibility for analysis. Various factors such as migration trends, socioeconomic advancements, and mortality and birth rates were considered in the preprocessing stage to provide a comprehensive view of population dynamics.

<h2>Visualization</h2> 
Utilizing Tableau, I generated a series of visualizations that offer a comprehensive view of the top and bottom 10 coutries, bullet chart to display the current and expected population, density vs Area population comparison and so on.
Thereafter summarizing everything into three dashboards first one focussing on Density Distribution, second one focusing on Demographics trends and last one showcasing Population shift from 1980 to 2050.

1. <h4>Density Distribution:</h4> Showcase the spread of population with respect to population density, offering insights into densely populated regions worldwide.

2. <h4>Demographic Shifts and Trends:</h4> Visualize the net change of the global population over the years, highlighting trends and fluctuations in population growth on a country, continent and hemisphere level.

3. <h4>Population Shift (1980-2050):</h4> Provide a comprehensive summary of our findings and analysis, offering key insights and observations derived from the visualized data.

<h2>Summary and Conclusion</h2>
<li>Analysis of global population dynamics highlights significant trends and insights that underscore the dynamic nature of population changes worldwide. </li>
<li> INDIA and CHINA emerge as countries with the highest populations, with INDIA projected to continue growing while CHINA experiences a decline. Countries like MACAU and MONACO exhibit remarkable population densities despite their small land areas. </li>
<li> Moreover, ASIA and EUROPE demonstrate the highest growth rates, notably in countries like SYRIA and MOLDOVA. </li>
<li> Recommendations stemming from our analysis include the promotion of birth control education in populous countries and encouraging immigration in less populated areas to address demographic challenges. </li>
<li> Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of proactive measures to manage population dynamics effectively for sustainable development globally. </li>
